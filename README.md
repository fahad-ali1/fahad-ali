# Description
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I have been wanting to create my own site for some time, to have a platform where I can showcase my projects while maintaining a sleek and modern web design. After some searching, I stumbled upon a template that resonated with me. I put in the effort to refine and personalize it to my liking.

In the process of creating this site, I've learned a handful of things about ReactJS, JavaScript, and CSS. This website was created following a tutorial by [EGATOR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Cr00UYokU&t=6801s)
